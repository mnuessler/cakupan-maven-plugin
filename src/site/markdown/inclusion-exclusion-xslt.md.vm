### Inclusion of XSL transformation files

By default, the Cakupan Plugin will automatically include all XSLT files with the following wildcard patterns:

* "**/*.xsl" - includes all of its subdirectories and all filenames that end with "xsl".

If your XSL files do not follow this naming convention, then configure the plugin and specify the files
(or wildcard pattern) you want to include:

	<project>
	  [...]
	  <build>
	    <plugins>
	      <plugin>
	        <groupId>${projectGroupId}</groupId>
	        <artifactId>${projectArtifactId}</artifactId>
	        <version>${projectVersion}</version>
	        <configuration>
	          <xsltIncludes>
	            <include>sample-transformation.xsl</include>
	          </xsltIncludes>
	        </configuration>
	      </plugin>
	    </plugins>
	  </build>
	  [...]
	</project>


### Exclusion of XSL transformation files

In certain cases it may be necessary to exclude XSLT files. To achieve this, the plugin can be configured as follows:

	<project>
	  [...]
	  <build>
	    <plugins>
	      <plugin>
            <groupId>${projectGroupId}</groupId>
            <artifactId>${projectArtifactId}</artifactId>
            <version>${projectVersion}</version>
	        <configuration>
	          <xsltExcludes>
	            <exclude>sample-transformation.xsl</exclude>
	          </xsltExcludes>
	        </configuration>
	      </plugin>
	    </plugins>
	  </build>
	  [...]
	</project>
